For the left Ruddervator the servo horn will be in the 3 o\u2019clock position pointing to the right side.</p> <p> 10. Plug in power source to Servo Programmer and plug in new servo to programmer. Set the programmer to prog mode using the slide switch on the right side of programmer. Using the Adjust set knob rotate until the 5/7 position is selected then press the adjust knob.  11. Using the pulse knob slowly rotate the knob until arrows are indicated on both sides of the \u201cPulse Center\u201d display.  12. After centered the programmer will return to the programming screen.  13. Place the new servo into the servo jig.  Note the servo horn might not be perfectly centered in the slot in the jig.  14. Press the adjust knob then rotate the pulse knob to center the servo horn to the slot in the jig.  In this position the servo horn is 90 deg to the servo when the servo is in the neutral position. Press the adjustment knob when servo horn is centered.  15. Using the adjustment knob select the left position then press the adjustment knob.  Slowly turn the pulse knob until value is set to -90 then press the adjust knob. Using the adjustment knob select the right position then press the adjustment knob.  Slowly turn the pulse knob until value is set to 90 then press the adjust knob. Then press the back button.</p> <p>Verify that the following values are set. | Limits                | -90/90 | |-----------------------|--------| | Deadband              | 1      | | Speed                 | 64     | | Failsafe              | Off    | | High Res              | Off    | | Over Limit Protection | Off    |</p> <p>You can now switch the programmer to the test position and select manual mode. Turning the pulse knob should rotate the servo. </p> <p>Reinstall the servo into the Ruddervator reversing steps 1-6. Use blue (242) lock tight when reinstalling the bolts and nuts. Make sure to use heat shrink on all solder connections.  16. Control arm length should not change during servo replacement.  Length from screw head to screw head should be ~ 79mm. Verify all control service movement and direction using aircraft controller.  </p>"},{"location":"#aileron-servo-replacement","title":"Aileron Servo Replacement","text":""},{"location":"#battery-replacement","title":"Battery Replacement","text":""},{"location":"#fuel-filter-checkclean","title":"Fuel Filter Check/Clean","text":""},{"location":"#vtol-prop-replacement","title":"VTOL Prop Replacement","text":""},{"location":"#engine-prop-replacement","title":"Engine Prop Replacement","text":""},{"location":"#landing-gear-replacement","title":"Landing Gear Replacement","text":""}]}
